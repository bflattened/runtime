# bflat Runtime and AOT Compiler

This repo is a fork of the [dotnet/runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) repo with customizations for the [bflattened/bflat](https://github.com/bflattened/bflat) project. The repo is mostly run by bots that pick up latest changes from the dotnet/runtime repo and generate build artifacts for consumption in the bflat repo.

The branches mirror branch names in dotnet/runtime: e.g. `bflat-main` is a mirror of `main` in dotnet/runtime.

Upstreaming changes to dotnet/runtime is strongly preferred to making changes in this repo.
